# A list is a sequence of values (similar to an array in other languages but more versatile)
# Values in lists are called items (or sometimes elements)

# The important properties of Python lists are:
# 1. Lists are ordered - Lists remember the order of items inserted.
# 2. Accessed by index - Items in a list can be accessed via an index.
# 3. Lists are mutable (can be changed) - You can change a list in-place, add new items, and delete or update existing items.
# 4. Items of a list don't have to be the same
# 5. A list containing zero items is called an empty list

# Create a list

# List of integers
L = [1, 2, 3]

# List of strings
L1 = ['red', 'yellow', 'blue']

# Lists can contain mixed data types
L2 = ['red', 3, False

# An empty list
L3 = []
